# CodSoft Data Science Internship Task 3 : Iris Flower Classification

# Name: Shreya Jayesh Biltheria

# BATCH - JAN Batch A25

## Overview

This repository documents the completion of Task 3 for the CodSoft Data Science Internship. The Iris Flower Classification project involves building a model to classify iris flowers based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to explore the iris dataset, perform data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and ultimately develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies iris flowers into different species. This project provides practical insights into the world of flower classification and equips you with valuable skills in data analysis and machine learning modeling.
