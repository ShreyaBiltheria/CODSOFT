# CodSoft Data Science Internship Task 2 : Movie Rating Prediction With Python

# Name: Shreya Jayesh Biltheria

## Overview

This repository documents the completion of Task 2 for the CodSoft Data Science Internship. The Movie Rating Prediction project involves building a model to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The objective is to analyze historical movie data, perform data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and ultimately develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics. This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing movie ratings and enables the creation of a predictive model for rating estimation.
